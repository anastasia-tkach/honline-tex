\caption{
We abstract the hand shape/pose estimation problem into the one of a simpler 2D stick-figure.  When the finger is straight (left), it is difficult to estimate finger length as the optimization problem is ill-posed, while with a bent finger (right) the problem is better conditioned.
% 
We analyze the energy landscape of the registration problem $E(\shape_1)$, and observe how estimation uncertainty relates to the width of the local minima valley. This certainty can be estimated through a quadratic approximation to $E(\shape_1)$, derived from the Jacobians of the registration energies.
