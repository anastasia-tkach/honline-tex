We evaluate our real-time calibration framework on twelve different subjects. For each user we show a frame in a (more-or-less) rest pose configuration, as well as a randomly selected frame from the recorded sequence \AN{It was not randomly selected, it is good looking one. Maybe change to \lq\lq{}another pose\rq\rq{}}. These results are better appreciated by watching our \VideoQualitative{}.
