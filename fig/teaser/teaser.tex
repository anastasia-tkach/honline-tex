Our adaptive tracking algorithm optimizes for a tracking model on-the-fly, leading to automatic improvements in  tracking accuracy over time. We color-code the surface to visualize the spatially-varying confidence of the estimated geometry. \todo{In the top-right of each frame we also visualize the template without over-imposing the point cloud.} \AT{should this be visualized in the rest pose?} The histograms visualize the uncertainty of each degree of freedom, that is the diagonal entries of the Hessian estimated from data in the current frame $\star\hessian$, or by accumulating the information through time $\hat\hessian$. These results are best appreciated by watching the supplementary \textbf{video}.
