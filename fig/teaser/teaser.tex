Our adaptive tracking algorithm optimizes for a tracking model on-the-fly, leading to automatic improvements in  tracking accuracy over time. We color-code the surface to visualize the spatially-varying confidence of the estimated geometry. The histograms visualize the uncertainty of each degree of freedom, that is the diagonal entries of the Hessian $\hessian$ estimated from data in the current frame $\isolated\hessian$, or by accumulating the information through time $\accumulated\hessian$.
