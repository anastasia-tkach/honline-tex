We estimate the parameter $\mu$ from two measurements $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$; these measurements are associated with uncertainty ellipsoids represented as their covariance matrices $\cov_1$ and $\cov_2$. The information in these two estimates can be compound, resulting in the joint estimate $\tilde{\mu}$. \AT{why the equations above look different from \Eq{combining}?} \AT{we might want to move this figure to the appendix too. It's quite basic, as it's just a visualization of the product rule of two gaussians, no? Or is there something else you'd like to say anastasia?}
